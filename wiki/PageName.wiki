= Clarify in the real world =

You have several dependencies to fulfill to use Clarify.
* Linux (so far - I have only tested on Ubuntu Edgy)
* xPDF - I used the Ubuntu package
* libtiff - I used the Ubuntu package
* NetPBM - I used the Ubuntu package
* tesseract-ocr - you have to build this one! easy easy: ./configure make make install

** *NOTE* you have to manually `cp -r ./tessdata /usr/local/bin` after building tesseract


= FAQ =

*Q.* Why would I ever want to use Clarify?

*A.* You have a PDF file or a Bunch of Tiffs that you want to perform OCR on in an automated/batch-process way.
